# sysk-forgets

This project downloads (`sync`s) the Stuff You Should Know RSS feed and stores it in a `search`able
database. The user then `select`s an episode they heard mentioned, contained in the episode they
heard it. A `queue` of published and upcoming episodes can be viewed. Finally, the user `generate`s
a RSS feed that can be imported into a podcast app as usual.

Add this RSS feed to your podcast app to automatically receive the episodes that I deem interesting
to listen to:
